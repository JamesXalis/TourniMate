## Description

* This application is to allow a user to register for a local golf tournament by the course selected!
* Our motivation to create this project is to help keep track of all local tournaments the user is registered for.
* Our group designed this webpage to help understand how to create a full stack MERN application in a team environment.
* The webpage allows the user to select a golf course, access all tournaments associated with the course, then register for those tournaments and make payment to confirm the users spot in the tournament.
* What we learned throughout the project:
